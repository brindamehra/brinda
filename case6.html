                     <h4>Abstract</h4></a>
                        <p> The growing popularity of livestreaming platforms like Twitch has generated a keen interest in how these platforms act as a  <em>third place</em> for the development of a community. Research focused on the social motivations of active Twitch users suggests that apart from providing entertainment and information, users are drawn towards these platforms <em>because</em> they facilitate social interaction and a chance for users to become part of a community based on shared activities and interests, through mediums like (internet relay chat) IRC channels. Studies posit that these elements of Twitch contribute to the development of a community, which is hugely alluring for users who lack external support in their daily lives. However, despite the focus on community and positive social interactions, Twitch is not always a supportive space. Malicious actors, known colloquially as <em>trolls</em>, often use derogatory and profane language to attack viewers on the IRC channels, and in extreme situations, carry out 'hate raids', a form of coordinated harassment by groups of trolls often targeted at minority or marginalized communities. 
                            
                        We argue that leveraging the same medium that is used to build the community (the IRC channel) to carry out harassment or malicious behaviour could have a negative impact on viewers – particularly those who are already vulnerable and are looking to Twitch as a form of emotional and social support. To counter this in a non-invasive manner, we present <em>StoryChat</em>, a narrative tool that reflects the mood of the ongoing chat and supports penalizing the trolls for their behaviour. </p>

                        <h4>Study Outcome</h4>

                        <p> This project was inspired by *WhoisZuki,* an ambient smartphone application that aims to increase physical activity and an active lifestyle by visualizing them in the form of a multi-chapter quest, where the main character is an avatar representative of the user. Having observed the importance of a narrative in encouraging and motivating users to carry out their physical activity goals, we believe that the narrative can act as a powerful tool in other scenarios as well. In our project, we use the *good versus evil* storyline as the basis for the *viewer versus troll* interaction. By pairing the moderation or banning of trolls with a visualization of the troll’s defeat on the IRC system, we hope to create a more positive and reassuring environment for the viewers. <strong> This project is still a work-in-progress, so stay tuned for updates!</strong>
