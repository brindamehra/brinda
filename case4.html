                    <h3 class="long-text"> "Did I Say That?": Understanding Speech as a Text Input Modality Through The Lens of Fuzzy Trace Theory  </h3>
                     <h4>Abstract</h4></a>
                        <p> This study explores the role of verbatim memory, speaking and respeaking in the context of text composition and attempted to understand how well participants could recall and reproduce the exact utterance across a variety of lengths and text types. The experiment used a 2x3 within-subjects design with participants being asked to produce two types of texts (Opinion or Experience) across a variety of lengths [Short (15-20 words), Medium (50-60 words), Long (250-300 words)]. Our results suggested that the ability of users to accurately recall their original compositions in a verbatim manner decreased as a function of length, supporting the tenets of the Fuzzy Trace Theory, which argues for a dual-trace conception of memory traces and supports the predominance of fuzzy (gist-based) memory traces over verbatim ones due to factors such as trace malleability, accessibility, processing complexity and effort, with processing information on a verbatim level requiring significantly more cognitive effort (Brainerd & Kingma, 1985). Instead, participants seemed to better recall the ‘gist’ of their original utterance, and felt that the quality of their gist-inspired recall was better than their original composition, including in factors like the clarity of the text, the grammar and the cohesion.</p>

                        <h4>Study Outcome</h4>

                        <p>Along with the <a href="case5.html"> Blurt-Ed </a> study, this exploration of how humans produce, store and recall original oral compositions is a part of our initial set of studies that work towards developing a more intuitive speech-to-text system based on how humans cognitively produce and process speech, which in turn was inspired by the lack of existing literature or exploration of speech in the field of HCI. <strong> This project is still a work-in-progress, so stay tuned for updates!</strong> </p>
