                     <h4>Abstract</h4></a>
                        <p> As 3D printing becomes more cheap and ubiquitous, an increasing number of people are starting to become interested in developing and printing 3D objects. However, current CAD systems are quite heavy for novice users – especially those without a technical background and often require extensive time and energy to learn. Additionally, CAD displays require manipulating a 3D object in a 2D space, and often need users to switch back and forth between a 3D viewpoint and an orthographic projection on a cutting plane for manipulation, which can be quite confusing for users who are not trained to ‘think in 3D’. Lastly, current systems constrain the user to the GUI, effectively restricting the mobility of both the designer and the object, and by extension, their ability to collaborate and think in an unconstrained fashion.

                        This project attempts to create an intuitive CAD system using a foldable display that is aimed at novice users. Inspired by woodworking tools, the system allows users to manipulate both orthographic and 3D objects by moving the screens. It supports functions like *extrude, snap, cut* and *rotate* while the foldable display allow the users to directly measure any parameters for the object by placing the phones on the angle of the object. </p>

                        <h4>Study Outcome</h4>

                        <p>  Developed for 3D hobbyists, this system allows users to transform a basic component into the object they would like to make using basic operations and information from the external environment. By creating a portable tool that allows manipulation on both a 3D and orthographic view, we hope to make it easier for novices to ‘think and model in 3D’ without having to worry about a steep learning curve and struggling with an overcrowded and not always intuitive interface. <strong> This project is still a work-in-progress, so stay tuned for updates!</strong>
                        </p>
