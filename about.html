                <h4>The <em>i</em> In My Name Is For <em>interdisciplinary</em></h4>
                <p>Hi! I'm Brinda, an aspiring researcher and UX engineer. Trained in psychology with a focus on neuro and cognitive science, I'm focused on gaining interdisciplinary skills and knowledge that will allow me to leverage principles of human behaviour to design and deploy studies that can lay the groundwork for more intuitive, human-friendly devices and systems. </p>
                <p>Apart from this, I enjoy teaching myself code and fiddling around with web development. I'm currently learning HTML/CSS and am hoping to start learning Javascript soon as I prepare for a career in UX research and engineering</p>
                <p>When I'm not crying over code, I enjoy reading science fiction and magical realism novels while running through my stash of tea at an alarming pace.</p>

                <h5>Brain and Cognitive Sciences</h5>
                <p>The human brain after all, (to borrow the quintessential Holmesian villain) is our very own Moriarty – a master controller, both powerful and elusive. The fact that the growing body of data on brain research only serves to highlight how little we still actually know about the brain, and the brain-mind-body connection is an endlessly fascinating topic , especially when one takes into account the incredible leaps in technology that have been made on the basis of the few things we do understand about the brain and the incredible potential of brain research that this indicates. It is likely that in order to continue facilitating technological advancements, we must parallely a more solid understanding of the way the brain comprehends, manipulates and transmits information and use that to inform the development of artificial intelligence. .</p>

                <h5> Techno-Philosophy and Human-Like AI</h5>
                <p>The Technium (although sounding like the title of a Spielberg dystopian movie) refers to the accumulation of inventions that humans have created; eventually transforming into an entity that society relies on as much as it does on nature. Kevin Kelly argues that the Technium is constrained by its own personal laws and evolutionary timeline, but at some point, will start to gain its own tendencies – it is an organism in and of itself, and as such can gain its own form of sentience. As we move further into the uncanny valley – developing generative systems that can mimic humans on a number of dimensions (see Sophia, XiaoIce...), we are forced to consider questions linked to our own existence and the existence of transhuman or even exohuman (not sure if this is a word) organisms. These questions lay the groundwork for the type of systems that will be developed and how and in what ways they will be integrated into our lives. </p>

                <h5>User Behaviour and Adaptiveness</h5>
                <p>We’re slowly reaching the tipping point where technology is no longer just indistinguishable from magic, but it begins to feel like magic to users as well. With the development of the blockchain-backed Web 3.0, artificial IoT and the ubiquitiousness of virtual + augmented reality, we’re moving towards a world where we could live in meta-reality (see Facebook...sorry, Meta). While the media equation theory argues that the human brain cannot evolve quickly enough to distinguish between human actors and computers, this growing trend of existing in meta-reality offers a unique chance to see how user behaviour and adaptiveness changes as a function of the technology they are exposed to, and how their interaction with these technologies impacts their lives – for better or worse. </p>
